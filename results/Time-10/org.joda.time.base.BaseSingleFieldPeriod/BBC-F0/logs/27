* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: BBC-F0
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.joda.time.base.BaseSingleFieldPeriod
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 17660
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Time-10/target/classes
  - defects4j/framework/projects/Time/lib/org/joda/joda-convert/1.2/joda-convert-1.2.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.base.BaseSingleFieldPeriod
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 459
* Using seed 4064467051
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 161 / 459
* Search finished after 301s and 1242 generations, 455421 statements, best individual has fitness: 47.0
