* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 893
* Using seed 1217463947
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 246 / 893
* Search finished after 301s and 255 generations, 104965 statements, best individual has fitness: 761.0
