  - defects4j/framework/projects/JacksonDatabind/lib/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-core/2.9.7/jackson-core-2.9.7.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
