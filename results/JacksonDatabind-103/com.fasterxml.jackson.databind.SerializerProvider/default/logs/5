  - defects4j/framework/projects/JacksonDatabind/lib/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-core/2.9.7/jackson-core-2.9.7.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializerProvider
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 1835
* Using seed 3917977728
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 932 / 1835
