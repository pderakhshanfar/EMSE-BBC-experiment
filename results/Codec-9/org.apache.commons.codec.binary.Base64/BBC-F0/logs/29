* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: BBC-F0
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 2999
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Codec-9/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 1539
* Using seed 4105153775
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 419 / 1539
* Search finished after 303s and 274 generations, 126991 statements, best individual has fitness: 91.0
