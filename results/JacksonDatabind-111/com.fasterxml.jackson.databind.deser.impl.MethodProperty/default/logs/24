* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: default
* Going to generate test cases for class: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.impl.MethodProperty
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 12325
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/JacksonDatabind-111/target/classes
  - defects4j/framework/projects/JacksonDatabind/lib/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-annotations/2.9.0/jackson-annotations-2.9.0.jar
  - defects4j/framework/projects/JacksonDatabind/lib/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-core/2.9.9/jackson-core-2.9.9.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.impl.MethodProperty
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 301
* Using seed 594030801
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 143 / 301
