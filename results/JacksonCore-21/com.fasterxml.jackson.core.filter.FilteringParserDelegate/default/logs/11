* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: default
* Going to generate test cases for class: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.FilteringParserDelegate
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 16953
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/JacksonCore-21/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.FilteringParserDelegate
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
