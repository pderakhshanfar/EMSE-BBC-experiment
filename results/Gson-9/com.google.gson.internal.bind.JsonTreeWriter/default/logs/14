* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: default
* Going to generate test cases for class: com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 15318
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Gson-9/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 425
* Using seed 766450353
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 191 / 425
* Search finished after 301s and 1790 generations, 330866 statements, best individual has fitness: 52.0
