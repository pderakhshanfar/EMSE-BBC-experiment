* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: BBC-F0-100
* Going to generate test cases for class: com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 9002
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Gson-9/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 978
* Using seed 502855734
* Starting evolution
bbc usage percentage is: 100%
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 386 / 978
