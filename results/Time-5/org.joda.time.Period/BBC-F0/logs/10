* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: BBC-F0
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.joda.time.Period
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 17059
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Time-5/target/classes
  - defects4j/framework/projects/Time/lib/org/joda/joda-convert/1.2/joda-convert-1.2.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.Period
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
