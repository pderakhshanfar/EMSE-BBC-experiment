  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 1736
* Using seed 576381914
* Starting evolution
bbc usage percentage is: 50%
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 1250 / 1736
