* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.model.dom.DOMAttributeIterator
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 371
* Using seed 49226124
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 81 / 371
* Search finished after 301s and 588 generations, 336730 statements, best individual has fitness: 58.0
