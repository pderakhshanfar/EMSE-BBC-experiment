* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.model.jdom.JDOMNodePointer
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
