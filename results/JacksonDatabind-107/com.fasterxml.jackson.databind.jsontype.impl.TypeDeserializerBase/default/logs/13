* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.impl.TypeDeserializerBase
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 442
* Using seed 2938677432
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 258 / 442
