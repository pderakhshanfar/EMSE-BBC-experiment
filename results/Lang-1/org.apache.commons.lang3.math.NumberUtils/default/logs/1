* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: default
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 21750
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Lang-1/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
