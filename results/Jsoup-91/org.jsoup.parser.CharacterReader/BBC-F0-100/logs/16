* EvoSuite 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Configuration: BBC-F0-100
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader
* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 5312
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - subjects/buggy-versions/Jsoup-91/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 1490
* Using seed 434568237
* Starting evolution
bbc usage percentage is: 100%
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 402 / 1490
