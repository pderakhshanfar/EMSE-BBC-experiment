* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.axes.AttributeContext
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 125
* Using seed 2898940330
* Starting evolution
* Initial Number of Goals in DynaMOSA = 50 / 125
* Search finished after 301s and 1863 generations, 489529 statements, best individual has fitness: 9.0
* Minimizing test suite
